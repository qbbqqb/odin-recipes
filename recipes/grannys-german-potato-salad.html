        <h1 class="heading">Granny's German Potato Salad</h1>
        <p id="description">This is a different potato salad for those who don't want a mayonnaise-based recipe. My family has enjoyed this for many years, and it is easy to adapt by adding more spices that suit your family.</p>

        <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="li1">8 white potatoes</li>
            <li class="li2">1 large onion</li>
            <li class="li1">2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li class="li2">1/2 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
            <li class="li1">1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li class="li2">1/4 cup cider vinegar</li>
            <li class="li1">1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
            <li class="li2">1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="ol">
            <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until just tender, about 15 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Put potatoes into a large bowl; add onion and stir.</li>
            <li>Mix sugar, mustard, and salt together in a bowl. Stir just enough vinegar into the sugar mixture to form a paste; season with black pepper.</li>
            <li>Whisk remaining vinegar and vegetable oil together in a separate bowl until smooth; stream into bowl with the paste, whisking continually to incorporate. Pour the dressing over the potato and onion mixture.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let salad cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
